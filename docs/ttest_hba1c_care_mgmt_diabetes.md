## Interpretation — t-test (HbA1c in diabetes: care-mgmt vs not)

**What the test says.**  
Care-management patients show **lower average HbA1c** than those not enrolled (effect size typically small–moderate), consistent with coaching/med support.

**What it means.**  
Some selection bias is likely (motivated patients enroll). Still, direction aligns with clinical intuition.

**Actions.**  
Scale care-mgmt for under-served cohorts; add **titration workflows** and meter reminders. Track **HbA1c change** at 3 & 6 months with a stepped-wedge rollout.
