# Executive summary

This 10‑year chronic‑care dataset highlights how operational and clinical signals move together.
We show:
- Clear utilization signals (admissions, ED) and clinical trend (HbA1c).
- Readmission drivers (logistic regression): LOS/ED touches, comorbidities, and engagement signals.
- Cost modeling (OLS): clinical risk + utilization + engagement.
- Variation by payer (ANOVA).
- Simple clinical outcome check (HbA1c under care management).

Outputs are reproducible via a one‑click GitHub Action.
